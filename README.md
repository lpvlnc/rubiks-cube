# 🏫 Academic Context

 This project was initially developed for the **Artificial Inteligence** discipline at Faculdade Dom Bosco de Porto Alegre. Our task was to develop a program that could solve a Rubik's cube, using either our own or a already known algorithm. To make it more fun we choose to make it a game.
 After the version was presented in class, **additional improvements** were made to enhance gameplay experience.
